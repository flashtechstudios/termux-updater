# termux-updater
 
I have combined the 2 commands to update the packes in termux into a script. Enjoy!

**MAKE SURE WGET IS INSTALLED!**
*(To verify run wget in termux. If wget isn't installed then run "pkg install wget")*
To run it:
- Run: > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themoonmeetsthesun/termux-updater/main/update.sh && sh update.sh
- If you want to execute it again, you can always run: > sh update.sh from the same directory in which you are in.
